## üß© Problem Statement

**Atliq Hardwares**, a leading manufacturer in the computer hardware industry, has built a strong presence in India and expanded globally. However, the executive management team is currently facing a major challenge:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è They do not have access to timely, data-driven insights to support smart and quick decision-making.

This lack of actionable analytics has resulted in delayed decisions and missed business opportunities.

To overcome this gap, **Tony Sharma**, Director of Data Analytics, is planning to **expand the data analytics team** by hiring junior data analysts who are skilled in both **technical (SQL)** and **soft (communication & storytelling)** skills.

To identify the best-fit candidates, he has designed a challenge that involves:

- Solving **10 ad hoc business data requests** from various stakeholders  
- Using **SQL** to query a structured database and extract meaningful insights  
- Preparing a **clear and compelling presentation** of findings for top-level executives  
- (Optional but encouraged) Creating a **video or audio walkthrough** of the presentation

This challenge aims to assess the candidate‚Äôs ability to:

- Think critically and solve business problems using data  
- Communicate complex information simply and effectively  
- Align technical outputs with strategic business goals

üìå The insights generated will directly help Atliq's management take informed actions to improve operations, sales, and overall business performance.
